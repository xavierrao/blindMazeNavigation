                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Blind Crown Quest is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game where 3 players race to reach the
                        Crown space while navigating a hidden, procedurally generated 5x5 grid. Players must explore,
                        collect gold, purchase items, and outsmart opponents to win.</p>

                <h3 class="collapsed">How many players can play?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Exactly 3 players are required for each game. The game will not start until all 3 players have
                        joined the room.</p>

                <h3 class="collapsed">How long does a typical game last?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Game length varies based on player strategy and luck, but most games last between 15-30 minutes.
                        With Memory Mode enabled, games may take longer as players must re-explore each round.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Be the first player to land on the Crown space with at least 5 gold. You must pay the 5 gold to
                        claim victory. If you reach the Crown without enough gold, you'll need to earn more before you
                        can win.</p>

                <h3 class="collapsed">What happens if I run out of gold?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>You can never go below 0 gold. If an effect would make you lose more gold than you have, you'll
                        be prompted to sell items at half their purchase price to cover the cost. If you can't or won't
                        sell items, you'll lose whatever gold you have remaining.</p>

                <h3 class="collapsed">What is Memory Mode?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>When Memory Mode is enabled, the game log clears at the end of each round. This forces players
                        to remember the map layout, item locations, and player positions without referencing past logs.
                        It significantly increases difficulty and strategic depth.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="collapsed">What does Random Start Space do?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Instead of all players starting on space 12 (the center-ish area), the start space is randomly
                        selected from any of the 25 spaces. This creates more varied gameplay as the map layout changes
                        based on the start position.</p>

                <h3 class="collapsed">Can I land on the same space as another player?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Yes! Multiple players can occupy the same space. This triggers the Combat wheel and enables
                        certain items like Close-Quarters Heist.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="collapsed">How does the map work?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>The game takes place on a 5x5 grid (25 spaces total) arranged like this:</p>
                    <div class="grid-example">
                        0 &nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;4<br>
                        5 &nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;7 &nbsp;&nbsp;8 &nbsp;&nbsp;9<br>
                        10 11 12 13 14<br>
                        15 16 17 18 19<br>
                        20 21 22 23 24
                    </div>
                    <p>Each space has a type (Start, Shop, Good, Bad, etc.) and connections to other spaces.
                        Connections can be cardinal (N, S, E, W) or diagonal (NE, NW, SE, SW).</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="collapsed">Why can't I see the whole map?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>The map is intentionally hidden to create a fog-of-war exploration experience. You must discover
                        connections by attempting to move or using items like Scout Lens. The map is revealed to all
                        players only when the game ends.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="collapsed">What are "non-adjacent" connections?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>These are long-range connections between spaces that aren't next to each other on the grid. For
                        example, space 0 (top-left corner) might have a diagonal connection to space 18 (bottom-right
                        area). These make navigation more complex and interesting.</p>

            <h2>Map Generation Logic</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="collapsed">How is the map generated?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>The map is procedurally generated using a Python script that runs server-side. Here's the
                        detailed process:</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 1: Space Type Assignment</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 Start space (default: space 12, or random if enabled)</li>
                        <li>1 Crown space</li>
                        <li>1 Shadow Realm space</li>
                        <li>1 Teleport space</li>
                        <li>2 Combat spaces</li>
                        <li>3 Good spaces</li>
                        <li>3 Bad spaces</li>
                        <li>3 Shop spaces</li>
                        <li>Remaining spaces become Neutral</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Phase 2: Outside Space Connections</strong></p>
                    <p>Spaces on the outer edge (0-4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 15, 19, 20-24) are connected to all cardinal (N,
                        S, E, W) adjacent outside spaces. This creates a navigable "ring" around the perimeter.</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 3: Non-Adjacent Connections (5% chance)</strong></p>
                    <p>Long-range diagonal connections are created with a 5% probability. Each space can only have one
                        non-adjacent connection per ordinal direction (NW, NE, SW, SE).</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 4: Cardinal Adjacent Connections (50% chance)</strong></p>
                    <p>For all spaces, cardinal adjacent connections are created with 50% probability. Maximum of 4
                        connections per space.</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 5: Diagonal Removal for Interior Spaces</strong></p>
                    <p>Spaces not on the outside edge cannot have diagonal connections to immediately adjacent spaces
                        (but can keep non-adjacent diagonal connections).</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 6: Crown Connections (Special Rule)</strong></p>
                    <p>The Crown space gets only ONE bidirectional connection to another space, making it harder to
                        reach and creating strategic bottlenecks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 7: Validation & Retry</strong></p>
                    <p>The algorithm validates that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All 25 spaces are reachable from Start</li>
                        <li>Crown is at least 3 steps away from Start</li>
                        <li>Crown has exactly 1 incoming connection</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If validation fails, the process repeats (up to 200 attempts).</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="collapsed">Can two games have identical maps?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Extremely unlikely. With random space type assignment, connection probabilities, and multiple
                        generation phases, the number of possible maps is astronomical. Even with the same start space,
                        maps will differ dramatically.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Yes! Some spaces might only have 1 or 2 connections, creating dead-end branches. This is
                        intentional and adds strategic depth - dead ends might contain valuable shops or dangerous Bad
                        spaces.</p>

                    <p>There are three mini-games that can be triggered from the Combat Wheel. All three players
                        compete simultaneously in these games:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Three-Player Tic-Tac-Toe (4x4 Grid)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Played on a 4x4 board with three symbols: X, O, and △</li>
                        <li>Each player has 3 pieces that can be placed</li>
                        <li>When a player has all 3 pieces on the board, placing a new piece removes their oldest piece</li>
                        <li>First player to get 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins</li>
                        <li>Only the current player can win on their own turn (prevents kingmaking)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>2. Tri-Color Reversi (6x6)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3-player version of Othello played on a 6x6 board</li>
                        <li>Three colors: ⚫ Black, ⚪ White, and 🔴 Red</li>
                        <li>Each player starts with 2 tiles in the center area</li>
                        <li>Modified flipping rule: When you place a tile, flip any straight line of contiguous tiles of a single color if your tile brackets them</li>
                        <li>Game ends when no valid moves remain for all players</li>
                        <li>Player with the most tiles of their color wins</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>3. Triple Clash</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All three players compete in simultaneous betting rounds</li>
                        <li>Each player starts with 5 "coins" (separate from main game gold)</li>
                        <li>Each round, all players secretly choose to bet 0-3 coins</li>
                        <li>Reveal: The highest unique bet wins the round, but that player loses those coins</li>
                        <li>If the highest bets are tied, all tied players lose their coins but nobody wins the round</li>
                        <li>Players who bet lower than the highest keep their coins</li>
                        <li>Game ends when all players run out of coins</li>
                        <li>Whoever won the most rounds wins the mini-game</li>

                <div class="faq-answer hidden">
                    <p>Combat mini-game rewards are determined by the Combat Wheel result that triggered the game:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>No, Combat mini-games are mandatory when triggered by the Combat Wheel. All three players must
                        participate. However, they're designed to be quick so they don't significantly slow down the main game.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Track other players</strong>: Remember where opponents are and what items they have

                    <p>Scout Lens is the most cost-effective exploration tool (2 gold, unlimited quantity). Buying 1-2
                        early helps you navigate and avoid Bad spaces.</p>

                    <p>Both strategies work! Rushing the Crown with minimal gold (hoping to land on Good/Shop spaces)
                        is risky but fast. Farming 10+ gold first is safer but gives opponents time to reach the Crown.
